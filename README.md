# Noise May Drown Out Words but Foster Compositionality: The Advantage of the Erasure and Deletion Noisy Channels on Emergent Communication` 

This repository contains supplementary materials for simulated emergence of language in noisy environments.
Two noise mechanisms (erasure and deletion) applied to messages generated by the sented are considered. 
The disentangled feature vectors were sourced from the [Dataset with Visual Attributes for Concepts](https://sites.google.com/view/carinasilberer/home) (Silberer et al., 2013), and the  pixel scenes were generated using a [modified script from the Obverter paper](https://github.com/benbogin/obverter/blob/master/data.py) (Choi et al., 2018). 
The experiments are based on the [EGG library](https://github.com/facebookresearch/EGG).

## Contents
- `src/` our contribution
- `data/` data export module
- `data/input_data/` exported intput datasets
- `runs/` contains raw results
- `figs/` figures

## Running with `uv`
```uv python install 3.8
uv venv --python 3.8
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip install -e EGG/```


## Training

```source .venv/bin/activate
uv run -m src.train --results_folder runs/ --filename run --data_path data/input_data/visa-5-256.npz ...```

Run `uv run -m src.train -h` for a list of all command line options.

## Exporting figures

To export figures, run the notebook `plots.ipynb` using Jupyter Lab:

```source .venv/bin/activate
uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab
```
